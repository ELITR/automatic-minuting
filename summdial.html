        <p>
          With a sizeable working population of the world going virtual, resulting in information overload from multiple online meetings, imagine how convenient it would be to just hover over past calendar invites and get concise summaries of the meeting proceedings? How about automatically minuting a multimodal multi-party meeting? Are minutes and multi-party dialogue summaries the same? We believe Automatic Minuting is challenging. There are possibly no agreed-upon guidelines to take minutes, and people adopt different styles to record minutes of the meeting. The minutes also depend on the meeting's category, the intended audience, and the goal or objective of the meeting. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The SummDial special session at <a href="https://www.sigdial.org/files/workshops/conference22/">SIGDial 2021</a> intends to instigate discussions on these challenges. Our goal for this SIGDial special session would be to stimulate intense discussions around this topic and set the tone for further interest, research, and collaboration in both Speech and Natural Language Processing communities. We are also launching a shared task on <a href="https://elitr.github.io/automatic-minuting/">Automatic Minuting (AutoMin)</a> at <a href="https://www.interspeech2021.org">Interspeech 2021</a>.

        <p>Klaus Zechner received his Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in 2001 for research on automated speech summarization. This work was published at SIGIR-2001 and in Computational Linguistics (2002).
Klaus Zechner is now a Senior Research Scientist in the Natural Language Processing Lab in the Research and Development Division of Educational Testing Service (ETS) in Princeton, New Jersey, USA. Since joining ETS in 2002, he has been pioneering research and development of technologies for automated scoring of non-native speech, leading large R&D projects dedicated to the continuous improvement of automated speech scoring technology. He holds more than 20 patents on technology related to SpeechRater®, an automated speech scoring system he and his team have been developing at ETS. SpeechRater is currently used operationally as sole score for the TOEFL® Practice Online (TPO) Speaking assessment and, in a hybrid scoring approach, also for TOEFL iBT Speaking.
Klaus Zechner authored more than 80 peer-reviewed publications in journals, book chapters, conference and workshop proceedings, and research reports. He also edited a book on automated speaking assessment that was published by Routledge in 2019; it provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art in automated speech scoring of spontaneous non-native speech. </p>

These papers would go through the same peer review process by the SIGDial program committee as papers submitted to the main SIGDial track. These papers will appear in the main SIGdial proceedings and are presented with the main track. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages, such as a small, focused contribution; a negative result; or an interesting application nugget. It should be no longer than 4 pages including title, text, figures and tables. An unlimited number of pages is allowed for references. One additional page is allowed for sample discourses/dialogues and algorithms, and an extra page is allowed in the final version to address reviewers’ comments.

Late-breaking and work-in-progress papers should be no longer than four pages including title, text, figures and tables, and references. These will be reviewed by the SummDial program committee and posted on the special session website. These papers will be presented as lightning talks or posters during the session. Authors will retain the copyright to their work so that they may submit to other venues as their work matures.</li>
          <li> <b>Position papers</b> will give voice to authors who wish to take a position on a topic listed above or the field of spoken, dialogue, meeting summarization. Submissions need not present original work and should be two to six pages in length including title, text, figures and tables, and references.
